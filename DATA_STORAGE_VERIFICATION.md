## 🎯 VERIFICATION RESULTS

### ✅ Data Storage: WORKING
- All user data is being stored in MongoDB
- Course enrollments are tracked
- Progress and quiz scores are saved
- Admin can view all data

### ✅ Data Retrieval: WORKING
- Courses load from database
- User progress is displayed
- Admin dashboard shows real data
- All APIs return correct data

### ✅ Data Persistence: WORKING
- Data survives server restarts
- User sessions maintained
- Progress tracking accurate
- No data loss observed

## 🚀 CONCLUSION

**DATA STORAGE IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL!**

The issue was not with data storage itself, but with API authentication requirements that prevented the frontend from loading course data. After making the course browsing endpoints public while keeping enrollment and progress tracking authenticated, the system now works perfectly.

**All data is being stored and retrieved correctly:**
- ✅ User accounts and authentication
- ✅ Course content and management
- ✅ Student enrollments and details
- ✅ Learning progress and quiz scores
- ✅ Admin data and system analytics

**The LMS is now fully functional with proper data storage!**
